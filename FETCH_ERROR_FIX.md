# 🔧 Failed to Fetch Error - FIXED!

## ❌ Error Encountered

```
Console TypeError
Failed to fetch

at fetchEquipment (app/biomedical/equipment/page.tsx:52:30)
at EquipmentManagement.useEffect (app/biomedical/equipment/page.tsx:46:5)
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The error occurred because:
1. **Backend was not running** on port 5000
2. **Frontend couldn't connect** to the API
3. **Multiple node processes** were running and conflicting

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **Step 1: Stopped All Node Processes**
```bash
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
```

### **Step 2: Restarted Backend Server**
```bash
cd d:\med\v3\server
node src/index.js
```

**Result**: 
```
✅ Server is running on port 5000
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
```

### **Step 3: Restarted Frontend Server**
```bash
cd d:\med\v3\client
npm run dev
```

**Result**: Frontend running and ready to connect

### **Step 4: Verified API Connection**
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/biomedical/equipment"
```

**Result**: ✅ Returns all 7 equipment items
