# ✅ DOCTOR ASSIGNMENT FIX - COMPLETE!

## 🔍 Problem Identified

**Error**: "Failed to assign doctor" when clicking the "Assign Doctor & Update Navigation" button

**Root Cause**: Express route ordering issue
- The generic `PUT /:id` route was matching before the specific `PUT /navigation/:patientId` route
- When a request came in as `PUT /api/patients/navigation/P1761233880345`, Express was treating `navigation` as the `:id` parameter
- This caused a 404 error: "Cannot PUT /api/patients/navigation/P1761233880345"

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Fixed Route Ordering in `server/src/routes/patients.js`

**Before** (Incorrect Order):
```
1. GET /
2. GET /qr/:patientId
3. GET /:id                    ← Generic route
4. PUT /:id                    ← Generic route (matches too early!)
5. PUT /qr/:patientId
6. PUT /navigation/:patientId  ← Specific route (never reached)
```

**After** (Correct Order):
```
1. GET /qr/:patientId          ← Specific routes first
2. PUT /qr/:patientId
3. PUT /navigation/:patientId   ← Specific routes
4. GET /                        ← Generic routes after
5. GET /:id
6. PUT /:id
```

### Key Changes Made

1. **Reorganized route definitions** to place specific routes before generic ones
2. **Added clear comments** separating specific and generic routes
3. **Ensured Express matches routes in correct order**

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Backend API Test ✅

```
🔵 Testing doctor assignment endpoint...
Response Status: 200 ✅
