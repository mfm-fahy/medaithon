## 💰 Discount Calculation

Total Discount % = Manual Discount % + Insurance Discount %
Total Discount Amount = Subtotal × Total Discount %
Taxable Amount = Subtotal - Total Discount Amount
Tax = Taxable Amount × Tax %
Final Total = Taxable Amount + Tax
```

### Example
```
Subtotal: ₹1000
Manual Discount: 10% = ₹100
Insurance Discount: 25% = ₹250
Total Discount: 35% = ₹350
Taxable Amount: ₹650
Tax (5%): ₹32.50
Final Total: ₹682.50
