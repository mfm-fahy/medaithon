# Patient Queue & QR Code Scanning Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
Implemented a complete patient queue management system with QR code scanning capabilities for doctors, nurses, lab technicians, and admin staff to view and update patient details.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Backend API Endpoints** (`server/src/routes/patients.ts`)

#### New Endpoints:
- **`GET /api/patients/qr/:patientId`** - Scan QR code to get patient details
  - Requires: doctor, nurse, lab-technician, or admin role
  - Returns: Patient info + vitals + prescriptions + lab tests
  
- **`PUT /api/patients/qr/:patientId`** - Update patient details after scanning
  - Requires: doctor, nurse, lab-technician, or admin role
  - Role-based updates:
    - **Doctor/Admin**: Can update medical history and allergies
    - **Nurse/Admin**: Can update medical history
    - **Lab Technician/Admin**: Can add lab notes to medical history

---

### 2. **Frontend Components**

#### **QR Scanner Component** (`client/components/qr-scanner.tsx`)
- Reusable QR code scanner for all staff roles
- Features:
  - Camera-based QR scanning
  - Manual Patient ID input fallback
  - Error handling and success messages
  - Responsive design

#### **Patient Queue Pages**

**Doctor Patients** (`client/app/doctor/patients/page.tsx`)
- View all patients in queue
- Scan QR code to find patient
- Update medical history and allergies
- Real-time patient list with search

**Nurse Patients** (`client/app/nurse/patients/page.tsx`)
- View all patients in queue
- Scan QR code to find patient
- Add nursing notes and observations
- Patient vitals tracking

**Lab Technician Patients** (`client/app/lab-technician/patients/page.tsx`)
- View all patients in queue
- Scan QR code to find patient
- Add lab test results and notes
- Allergy information display

**Admin Patients** (`client/app/admin/patients/page.tsx`)
- View all patients in system
- Search by name, patient ID, or phone
- Update medical history and allergies
- Full patient management

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Role-Based Access Control**
- Each role can only access their designated pages
- API endpoints validate user role before allowing updates
- Different update permissions based on role

✅ **Authentication Required**
- All endpoints require valid JWT token
- Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated

✅ **Data Validation**
- Patient ID format validation (P{timestamp})
- Input sanitization
- Error handling for invalid requests

---

## 📱 API Response Format

### Get Patient by QR Code:
```json
{
  "patient": {
    "_id": "...",
    "patientId": "P1729689600000",
    "userId": { "name": "...", "email": "..." },
    "age": 30,
    "sex": "male",
    "phone": "...",
    "medicalHistory": "...",
    "allergies": ["Penicillin"]
  },
  "vitals": [...],
  "prescriptions": [...],
  "labTests": [...]
}
```
