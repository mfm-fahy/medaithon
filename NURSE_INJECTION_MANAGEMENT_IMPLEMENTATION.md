# 💉 Nurse Injection Management Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive injection management system for nurses to update and track patient injections in real-time.

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Injection Management Page** (`client/app/nurse/injections/page.tsx`)
- **View all pending injections** for patients
- **Search functionality** by patient name, patient ID, or injection name
- **Filter by status**: All, Pending, In-Progress, Completed, Cancelled
- **Update injection status** with three actions:
  - ✅ **Start Injection** (Pending → In-Progress)
  - ✅ **Mark as Done** (In-Progress → Completed)
  - ❌ **Cancel** (Any status → Cancelled)
- **Add/Edit notes** for each injection
- **Real-time status updates** with visual indicators
- **Summary statistics** showing total, pending, in-progress, and completed injections

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints** (`server/src/routes/injections.js`)

#### GET Endpoints
- `GET /api/injections` - Get all injections (admin, doctor, nurse)
- `GET /api/injections/patient/:patientId` - Get injections for specific patient
- `GET /api/injections/:id` - Get single injection details

#### POST Endpoints
- `POST /api/injections` - Create new injection (doctor, admin)

#### PUT Endpoints
- `PUT /api/injections/:id/status` - Update injection status (nurse, admin)
- `PUT /api/injections/:id` - Full injection update (doctor, nurse, admin)

#### DELETE Endpoints
- `DELETE /api/injections/:id` - Delete injection (doctor, admin)

### 3. **Nurse Dashboard Integration**
- Added new **"Injections"** card to nurse dashboard
- Quick access to injection management from main dashboard
- Icon: 💉

## 📝 Files Modified

### Backend
- **`server/src/index.js`**
  - Added import: `const injectionsRoutes = require('./routes/injections');`

## 🔄 Workflow

### Doctor Perspective
1. Doctor prescribes injection to patient
2. Injection record created in MongoDB with status: **pending**
3. Patient's `injectionDetails` updated with injection information

### Nurse Perspective
1. Nurse logs in and goes to dashboard
2. Clicks on **"Injections"** card
3. Views all pending injections
4. Can search by patient name, ID, or injection name
5. Can filter by status (pending, in-progress, completed, cancelled)
6. For each injection:
   - Clicks **"Start Injection"** to mark as in-progress
   - Adds notes about the injection
   - Clicks **"Mark as Done"** when injection is completed
   - Can cancel if needed
7. Status updates in real-time
8. Summary statistics update automatically

## 🎨 UI Components Used

- **Card** - Display injection details
- **Button** - Action buttons for status updates
- **Badge** - Display injection type and status
- **Input** - Search field
- **Textarea** - Notes field
- **Icons** - CheckCircle, Clock, AlertCircle for status indicators

---

## 🔐 Security & Authorization

- **Authentication**: JWT token required for all endpoints
- **Role-based Access Control**:
  - **GET /api/injections**: admin, doctor, nurse
  - **POST /api/injections**: doctor, admin
  - **PUT /api/injections/:id/status**: nurse, admin
  - **DELETE /api/injections/:id**: doctor, admin

## 📊 Database Schema

### Injection Collection
```javascript
{
  patientId: ObjectId (ref: Patient),
  doctorId: ObjectId (ref: Doctor),
  injectionName: String (required),
  injectionType: String (enum: IV, IM, SC, Intradermal, Other),

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "completed", "notes": "Injection administered successfully"}' \
  http://localhost:5000/api/injections/<injection_id>/status
```
