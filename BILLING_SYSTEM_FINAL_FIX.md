# ✅ Billing System - FINAL FIX!

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

The error "Cannot POST /api/billing/create" was happening because:

1. **Missing Queue Route** - The billing system was trying to call `/api/queue/remove` but the queue route didn't exist
2. **Server Not Restarted** - The new routes weren't loaded
3. **Route Not Registered** - The queue route wasn't registered in the server

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **1. Created Queue Route** (`server/src/routes/queue.js`)
- ✅ Remove patient from queue
- ✅ Get all patients in queue
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Logging for debugging

### **2. Registered Queue Route**
- ✅ Added to `server/src/index.js`
- ✅ Registered as `/api/queue`
- ✅ Available for pharmacist and admin

### **3. Verified Billing Route**
- ✅ Billing route is properly configured
- ✅ All middleware is correct
- ✅ Error handling is in place
