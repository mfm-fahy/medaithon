## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React `useState` hook
- `visitScheduled` boolean state
- Passed as prop to child components

### Component Communication
- Parent (PatientHome) manages state
- VisitForm triggers callback on success
- PatientNavigation receives state as prop
- Conditional rendering based on state

### Callback Flow
```typescript
// In PatientHome
const [visitScheduled, setVisitScheduled] = useState(false)

// Pass callback to VisitForm
<VisitForm onSuccess={() => setVisitScheduled(true)} />

// Pass state to PatientNavigation
<PatientNavigation visitScheduled={visitScheduled} />

// In VisitForm
if (onSuccess) {
  onSuccess()  // Updates parent state
}
```
