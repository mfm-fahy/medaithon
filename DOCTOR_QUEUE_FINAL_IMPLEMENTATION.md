# âœ… DOCTOR QUEUE SYSTEM - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION

## ðŸŽ‰ System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The doctor queue system is now fully implemented and ready for testing!

---

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Fixed

### Issue: Doctor Dashboard Not Showing Patient Queue
**Problem**: When a nurse allocated a patient to a doctor, the patient didn't appear in the doctor's queue on the dashboard.

**Root Cause**: The doctor dashboard was using `(user as any)?._id` to get the doctor ID, but the login response returns `id` not `_id`.

**Solution**: Updated the doctor dashboard to use both `_id` and `id` fields:
```typescript
const doctorId = (user as any)._id || (user as any)?.id
```

**Files Modified**:
- `client/app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fixed doctor ID retrieval in 3 places

## ðŸ”§ Complete Implementation

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

**1. Patient Model** (`server/src/models/Patient.js`)
- Added `assignedDoctor` field with doctor details
- Added `inQueue` and `queuePosition` fields

**2. WebSocket Manager** (`server/src/services/websocket.js`)
- Doctor client registration and management
- Real-time queue broadcasting

**3. API Endpoints** (`server/src/routes/patients.js` & `server/src/routes/doctors.js`)
- `GET /api/patients/doctor/:doctorId` - Fetch patients for doctor
- `PUT /api/patients/navigation/:patientId` - Assign doctor to patient
- `GET /api/doctors?specialization=...` - Get doctors by specialization

**4. WebSocket Server** (`server/src/index.js`)
- Doctor connection handling via query parameters
- Real-time message broadcasting

### Frontend (Next.js/React)

**1. Doctor Dashboard** (`client/app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Fetches patients from backend API
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Displays patient queue with positions
- Shows WebSocket connection status

**2. Assign Doctor Page** (`client/app/nurse/assign-doctor/page.tsx`)
- Doctor category selection
- Doctor dropdown with available doctors
- Real-time doctor fetching by specialization
