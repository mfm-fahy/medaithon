# ✅ Lab Technician QR Code Scanner & Test Result System - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

A complete QR code scanning system for lab technicians to:
- ✅ Scan patient QR codes to fetch patient details
- ✅ View all pending lab tests for the patient
- ✅ Set estimated time for test completion
- ✅ Add test results (text or file upload)
- ✅ Submit results to backend
- ✅ Send real-time notifications to doctor and patient apps

## 📱 QR Scanner Page Features

### **1. QR Code Scanning**
- Real QR scanner placeholder
- Manual patient ID input field
- Fetches patient details from backend using `/api/patients/qr/:patientId`
- Displays patient info: Name, Age, Sex, Email

### **2. Patient Validation**
- Verifies patient exists in database
- Shows error if patient not found
- Displays success message with patient name
- Shows patient details card before proceeding

### **3. Navigation**
- Proceeds to tests page with patient MongoDB ID
- Back button to return to dashboard

## 🧪 Lab Tests Page Features

### **1. Patient Information Display**
- Shows patient ID, name, age, sex
- Displayed at top of page for reference

### **2. Lab Tests List**
- Fetches all pending tests for patient
- Shows test name, sample type, status
- Displays estimated time if set
- Shows result if completed
- Shows uploaded file if available

### **3. Test Status Management**

**Pending Tests:**
- Set Estimate Time button
- Input fields for hours and minutes
- Submits to backend via PUT `/api/lab-tests/:id`

**In-Progress Tests:**
- Add Result button (text input)
- Upload Result File button (PDF, JPG, PNG, DOC, DOCX)
- Both submit to backend and mark as completed

**Completed Tests:**
- Shows result value or file details
- Download button for uploaded files
- No further actions available

### **4. Real-time Notifications**
- When result is submitted, sends WebSocket notification to:
  - **Patient App** - Shows test result notification
  - **Doctor App** - Shows test result notification
- Includes test name, result, and timestamp

---

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### **1. Updated Lab Tests Route** (`server/src/routes/lab-tests.js`)

**Enhanced PUT Endpoint:**
```javascript
PUT /api/lab-tests/:id
```

- Accepts: status, estimatedTime, result, resultDate, uploadedFile
- Populates patient data
- Sends WebSocket notifications when test is completed
- Notifies both doctor and patient

**WebSocket Notifications Include:**
- Test ID, name, status
- Result value or file details
- Patient ID and name
- Timestamp

### **2. WebSocket Integration**
- Uses existing `wsManager.sendNavigationUpdate()` for patient
- Uses existing `wsManager.broadcastToDoctorQueue()` for doctor
- Sends notification type: `lab-test-result`
