# 🔧 Pharmacist Queue - Null Reference Error Fix

## ❌ Error Found
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'userId')
app/pharmacist/queue/page.tsx (349:69)
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The code was trying to access `prescription.doctorId.userId?.name` but `doctorId` was `null`:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - doctorId is null, so can't access .userId
Prescribed by: {prescription.doctorId.userId?.name || "Unknown"}
```

This happens when:
1. Prescription data doesn't include doctor information
2. Doctor reference is not populated from the database
3. No safety check for null values

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File**: `client/app/pharmacist/queue/page.tsx` (Line 349)

**Before**:
```typescript
Prescribed by: {prescription.doctorId.userId?.name || "Unknown"}
```

**After**:
```typescript
Prescribed by: {prescription.doctorId?.userId?.name || prescription.doctorId?.name || "Unknown"}
```

### What This Does
1. ✅ Safely checks if `doctorId` exists (using `?.`)
2. ✅ Safely checks if `userId` exists (using `?.`)
3. ✅ Falls back to `doctorId.name` if `userId` doesn't exist
4. ✅ Falls back to "Unknown" if nothing is available
