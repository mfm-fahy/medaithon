# ✅ QR SCANNER FIX - PATIENT DETAILS NOW SHOWING

## 🔧 Problem Identified & Fixed

### Issue
When nurse scanned QR code, it showed "Patient not found" error.

### Root Cause
The `.env` file was manually updated to use MongoDB Atlas connection string, but the patient data was still in the old local MongoDB database. The backend was trying to find patients in the new MongoDB Atlas database where no data existed.

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Reseeded the database with all test users and patient records
2. ✅ Restarted the backend server
3. ✅ Verified MongoDB connection to Atlas
