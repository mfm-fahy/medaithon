## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Backend API Routes** (`server/src/routes/injections.js`)
Complete REST API for injection management with 7 endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Auth |
|--------|----------|---------|------|
| GET | `/api/injections` | Get all injections | admin, doctor, nurse |
| GET | `/api/injections/patient/:patientId` | Get patient injections | all |
| GET | `/api/injections/:id` | Get single injection | all |
| POST | `/api/injections` | Create injection | doctor, admin |
| PUT | `/api/injections/:id/status` | Update status | nurse, admin |
| PUT | `/api/injections/:id` | Full update | doctor, nurse, admin |
| DELETE | `/api/injections/:id` | Delete injection | doctor, admin |

### 2. **Nurse Injection Management Page** (`client/app/nurse/injections/page.tsx`)
Complete UI for nurses to manage injections with:

#### Features:
- ✅ **View all injections** with patient details
- ✅ **Search functionality** (patient name, ID, injection name)
- ✅ **Filter by status** (All, Pending, In-Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
- ✅ **Update injection status**:
  - Start Injection (Pending → In-Progress)
  - Mark as Done (In-Progress → Completed)
  - Cancel (Any → Cancelled)
- ✅ **Add/Edit notes** for each injection
- ✅ **Visual status indicators** (icons and color-coded badges)
- ✅ **Summary statistics** (total, pending, in-progress, completed)
- ✅ **Real-time updates** with loading states
- ✅ **Responsive design** (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### 3. **Nurse Dashboard Integration** (`client/app/nurse/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Added new **"Injections"** card (💉)
- Quick navigation to injection management page
- Consistent styling with other dashboard cards

### 4. **Server Integration** (`server/src/index.js`)
- Imported injections routes
- Mounted routes at `/api/injections`
