# ✅ DOCTOR QUEUE SYSTEM - FIXED & WORKING!

## 🎉 Issue Resolved!

The doctor queue system is now fully operational! The error has been fixed and patients are now showing in the doctor's queue.

---

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

### The Problem
When doctors logged in, the patient queue showed an error:
```
❌ Error response: {}
Failed to fetch patient queue
```

### Root Cause
The doctor login response was returning the User's `_id`, but the patient's `assignedDoctor.doctorId` field stores the Doctor model's `_id`. These are different MongoDB IDs:
- User `_id`: ID from User collection
- Doctor `_id`: ID from Doctor collection

When the frontend tried to fetch patients using the User `_id`, the backend couldn't find any matches because it was looking for the Doctor `_id`.

---

## ✅ The Fix

### File Modified
- `server/src/routes/auth.js`

### Changes Made
Added code to fetch the doctor's MongoDB `_id` from the Doctor collection during login:

```javascript
// If doctor, fetch and include doctor's _id and specialization
if (user.role === 'doctor') {
  const doctor = await Doctor.findOne({ userId: user._id });
  if (doctor) {
    responseUser._id = doctor._id; // Use doctor's MongoDB _id
    responseUser.specialization = doctor.specialization;
    console.log('👨‍⚕️  Doctor found:', doctor._id, 'Specialization:', doctor.specialization);
  }
}
```

### What This Does
1. Finds the doctor record using the User's `_id`
2. Extracts the Doctor's `_id` (from Doctor collection)
3. Returns it in the login response
4. Frontend now uses the correct Doctor `_id` to fetch patients
