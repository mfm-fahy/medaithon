# ✅ QR Code Feature - Build Error Fixed!

## 🔧 Issue Fixed

### Problem:
```
Export default doesn't exist in target module
./components/patient/qr-code-display.tsx (3:1)

Import traces:
  - qrcode.react doesn't export default
  - Need to use named export QRCodeCanvas
```

### Solution:
Changed the import from default export to named export:

**Before:**
```typescript
import QRCode from "qrcode.react"
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { QRCodeCanvas } from "qrcode.react"
```

Also updated the component usage:
```typescript
// Before
<QRCode ... />

// After
<QRCodeCanvas ... />
```
