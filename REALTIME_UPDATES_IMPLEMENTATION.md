## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### `server/src/routes/patients.js`
**Added WebSocket notifications when doctor is assigned**:

```javascript
// Import WebSocket manager
const wsManager = require('../services/websocket');

// In PUT /navigation/:patientId endpoint:
// Send real-time WebSocket update to patient
wsManager.sendNavigationUpdate(patientId, patient.hospitalNavigation);
wsManager.storeNavigationUpdate(patientId, patient.hospitalNavigation);
```

**What Happens**:
1. Nurse assigns doctor category and room
2. Backend updates patient in database
3. Backend sends WebSocket message to patient
4. Patient app receives update instantly
5. UI updates with animation

### Frontend Changes

#### `client/app/patient/navigation/page.tsx`
**Enhanced with real-time update handling**:

```typescript
// New state for animations
const [showUpdateAnimation, setShowUpdateAnimation] = useState(false)
const [updateMessage, setUpdateMessage] = useState("")

// WebSocket message handler
websocket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
  
  if (data.type === 'navigation-update') {
    // Update navigation data
    setNavigation(data.data)
    setRealtimeWaitTime(data.data.estimatedWaitTime)
    setLastUpdate(new Date())
    
    // Show animation
    setUpdateMessage('📍 Your appointment location has been updated!')
    setShowUpdateAnimation(true)
    setTimeout(() => setShowUpdateAnimation(false), 3000)
  }
}
```
