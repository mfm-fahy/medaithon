# ✅ Billing Validation Error - FIXED!

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

The error "Please fill in medicine name and price for all items" was showing even when you filled in the fields. This was because:

1. **Validation was too strict** - It checked for empty values even when you just added a new item
2. **No visual feedback** - You couldn't see which fields were missing
3. **Confusing error messages** - Generic message didn't tell you what was wrong

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Better Validation Logic**
- ✅ Only validates when you click "Create Bill"
- ✅ Separate checks for each requirement
- ✅ Clear error messages for each issue

### **Visual Feedback**

### **Better Error Messages**
