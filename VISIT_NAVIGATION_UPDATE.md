# Visit Scheduling Navigation Update

## 🎯 Overview
Updated the patient visit scheduling form to automatically navigate to the OP Nurse page after successfully scheduling a visit.

---

## ✅ What Was Changed

### File Modified
- `client/components/patient/visit-form.tsx`

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Added Router Import**
```typescript
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"
```

#### 2. **Initialize Router Hook**
```typescript
const router = useRouter()
```

#### 3. **Updated Success Handler**
After successful visit scheduling, the component now:
- Shows success message for 2 seconds
- Automatically navigates to `/nurse/patients` page
- Calls the `onSuccess` callback if provided

**Before:**
```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  setSuccess(false)
  if (onSuccess) {
    onSuccess()
  }
}, 2000)
```

**After:**
```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  setSuccess(false)
  if (onSuccess) {
    onSuccess()
  }
  // Navigate to OP nurse page
  router.push("/nurse/patients")
}, 2000)
```

## 🔄 User Flow

2. Patient fills out visit form:
   - Selects visit type (New or Follow-up)
   - Describes symptoms
   - Adds optional details
3. Patient clicks "Schedule Visit"
4. System validates and creates visit
5. Success message displays for 2 seconds
6. **Automatically navigates to OP Nurse page** (`/nurse/patients`)

## 🔐 Security Considerations

✅ **Authentication Required**
- Navigation only happens after successful API call
- User must be authenticated to access `/nurse/patients`
- If not authenticated, Next.js will redirect to login

✅ **Error Handling**
- If visit creation fails, no navigation occurs
- Error message is displayed to user
- User can retry scheduling

---

## 📊 API Integration

### Visit Creation Endpoint
- **URL**: `/api/visits`

- **Headers**: Authorization Bearer token
- **Body**:
  ```json

    "visitType": "new" | "follow-up",
    "symptoms": "string",
    "description": "string (optional)"
  }
  ```

### Response
- **Success (201)**: Visit created, navigation triggered
- **Error (4xx/5xx)**: Error message displayed, no navigation
